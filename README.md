This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python code that can arise when dealing with list processing, specifically calculating the average of a list of numbers. The initial code does not properly handle the cases where the input list is empty or contains non-numeric elements, which can lead to runtime errors. The solution demonstrates how to handle these edge cases effectively, providing a more robust and reliable function.
